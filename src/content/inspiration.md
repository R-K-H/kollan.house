Inspiration!

What have you done to me? Where have you come from? Where will you go?

As if we chase each other in the night, bounding across the plane of existence, twirling in a cosmic dance. Filled with hope and love, how best can I express what you mean, not just to me, but to the world you're a part of. For it's you, at the source, of all that is wonderful in this world, this world is made for you it happens for you, because of you.

Stand up! Shout off the mountain tops! For you are here and today is your day!
