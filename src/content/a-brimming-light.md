“It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.”
- Confucius

I know at times things can seem a long play, the future can be so far away (especially in a world where we can just push dopamine buttons and watch as likes go up and up) compared to what is in our immediacy. A series of small actions, shape our lives in huge ways over time, and it’s in this that everything is borne. So why bring this up? Because the things you want, the things you do, are all a matter of setting those intentions, and chipping away task by task, one by one, to make a masterpiece.

You shared with me you want a few things for your life right now, to be accountable for, exercise, eating and study, you want to end toxic relationships and cultivate and care for healthy ones. That seems to make a lot of sense and I do want to support you in that, I want others to support you also, by stating things aloud and enrolling others in the possibilities, you have more opportunity for accountability. I would encourage you to do just that. Also do not fear falling out of integrity, it happens: “The best laid schemes o' mice an' men / Gang aft a-gley.” (“To a Mouse,” by Robert Burns). Meaning no matter what we plan, almost always the plans don’t work out how we planned. Just don’t let that throw a divide or create anxiety, if anything it’s an opportunity and an exercise in how we restore integrity. For me integrity means workable (thanks Landmark), and all I strive to do is create workable environments. So in that all you’re doing is creating workable situations even if we fall in and out of workability.

What I’m getting at here is something I touched base on, sometimes when we do things we know we don’t want to do, or things we think we should but don’t, we put a lot of pressure on ourselves. This doesn’t need to happen and instead can be reconfigured so that stuff doesn’t pile up, commitments aren’t made as easily, feelings are kept in check, yada yada. All in an effort to manage life in a way unlike anything else. Don’t let things pile up, understand that dealing with something is infinitely easier than dealing with the burden your mind puts on you. That being said, keeping what you deal with manageable is the task that now faces you.

It’s ok to say no. That’s something that has taken me the better part of seven years to learn and each day I’m still in struggle with it, as it’s not my default. All I can say is, don’t fret along the way, you are powerful even when you stumble and we all do, it’s just opening up to that and like you had the reflection of me. You don’t put on a show, just be you, in your entirety, this isn’t a sales pitch, this is a human being human. If people who are around you do not understand that, then find some other humans ;)

I look at you and I just think of the word awesome and as Orwell has articulated use the words properly. Awesome: “extremely impressive or daunting; inspiring great admiration, apprehension, or fear.”
