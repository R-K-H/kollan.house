There are two things my grandmother used to sing us in the morning to wake us up and I learned it was because her mother sang it her, I wonder how long this has gone on.

The first is:
"Good morning folks and howdy, the old dutch girl is singing."

The second is:
"Good morning to you, we're all in our places, with bright shiny faces."

I'm very fond of these memories and will likely carry the torch into the future. She has all kinds of little phrases and sayings which are kind of a tickle to my heart. For example "Off we are like a herd of turtles.."

Anyways I wanted to explore joy this wonderful morning. What brings you joy, what are you thankful for, what memories do you have which just warm your heart? In a rough world and an unknown universe it's important to have those things we can count on to bring us back into a good state of being. It won't always work, but if you look back it's often the smallest little things that people do or say that can have such a profound memory. And at the end of the day, if that doesn't say, stop and smell the roses, I'm not sure what else will.

So with your day today, take a moment to hold space for gratitude, find peace in the smallest of details and share your stories with the world.

Good morning! I'm very thankful to share these stories with you, very thankful for having the opportunity to get to know you and hear your stories, it brings me so much joy.
