Your lines and curves so striking
Without a chance, lost in liking
Liking, love? Loving, like?
Never sun, always bright
God damnit, grant me one more sight
Another glance
For another night
Ahhhh
If ever before there was a time
And in time it ever could
Should we?
Would we?
With you it’s a dance among the stars
Light feet, head and heart
But oh,
In this morning gaze, mind a-racing
I feel the pull, I see the smile
It’s a new day, a new chance to be
And in being, we circle back
In you, the world worth fighting

Love truly in every sense of the word. I wish it for you, and wish this day to be filled with it. Enjoy this day and what it brings, today is the day you start to take over the world.
