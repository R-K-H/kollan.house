Finishing up Chernobyl series and the end of the show's quote:

> To be a scientist is to be naive. We are so focused on our search for truth we fail to consider how few, actually want us to find it.  But it is, always there, whether we see it or not, whether we choose to or not. The truth doesn't care about our needs or wants, it doesn't care about our governments, our ideologies, our religions. It will lie in wait for all time. And this at last is the gift of Chernobyl. Where I once feared the cost of truth, now I only ask: What is the cost of lies?

Really left me with something to think about, how much does it serve us to be in a lie? And at the expense of others?
