"The essence of being human is that one does not seek perfection."
- George Orwell

For what it's worth, I think you're perfect. As is, no additional assembly required. :-p

Nothing crazy today, just happy to be here, happy to be a part (in whatever way) of your existence. Careening on this spaceship through the infinite towards the unknown. 

Good morning! I wish for you an inspiring day, may your mind exist in peace, your thoughts flow freely and accomplishment come easy.
