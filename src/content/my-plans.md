This has been an exercise in future thought and has been extremely good for me in very many ways, I’ve really felt this has been something beyond what I had set out to do in the first place, and I hope it just shows you just how much I put into things. All that being said, you asked and I shared my 20 year plan for posterity's sake and part of this discovery I’m including it below. 

My 20 year plan is to build spacecraft or spacecraft systems.

This can be developed along many different paths and the affordable technologies that will get us there are just beginning.

With that in mind, the rough outline would be as follows.

Unite like minded persons with the objective and understanding that this world is but the first launch point of all of humanity’s future.
Develop strategies and goals and objectives for such a mission.
Solicit funding.
Develop technologies that will benefit such strategies, goals and objectives.
Implement technologies and strategies for mission.
Launch mission.

There are steps to get there, and 20 years to do it.

Year 1-5
Build business(es) to subsidise income and build skills and knowledge for future ventures.
Build a reputation for consciousness and thought related to the universe and human exploration.
Hone skills in business and project management, learn to communicate and build processes and automate systems.
Project definition and outline
Hiring and filling roles
Management of roles
Responsibility
Process development
Optimization
Automation

Income enough to support living costs, travel (home), business development and education. (~$4010/mo or $50k year) (indicative of a business owner’s/ partner’s draw of salary or rev share based on company performance or % ownership of company)
Be able to support my family in times of need. (Sister, brother, mom, dad, grandmother etc)
Start fund for workshop and technologies needed to develop skills with 3D printing, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, propulsion systems and manufacturing. ($14,000 CNC, $10,000 3D Printer, $20,000 Tools and Equipment, $4,000 Rent, etc)
Continue education for above skills (hands on).
Work on development for personal data tracking.
Reach out to influencers to seek xp or tips tricks and other.
Attend conferences, lectures or events for said industries.
Attend and participate in competitions related to the above.]
Buy a motorcycle.
Buy a car.
Payback student loans. ($12k) and medical debt. ($30k)
Repair credit.
Speak to at risk youth and adults about surviving suicide attempts.

Year 5-10
After research and building a business that utilizes the above technologies and skills, begin to solicit and hire individuals which will bring value and skills to the company.
Begin aerospace research division.
Expand workshop and offer partners a place to test/ develop/ converse.
Outline plan for breaking into the industry. (Right now I’m thinking flight systems or cockpits)
Develop test craft and demos for current planes, etc. (Kind of like pimp my ride)
With plan seek funding or bootstrap. ($100million+)
Write a book.
Build an airplane.

Year 10-20
Grow business and branch to actual manufacturing of flight control systems, propulsion systems, spacecraft manufacturing, system software for space flight, emergency systems and recovery and processes for repair and continuation of mission based on 3D printing technologies.
Launch first craft by year 20.

BHAG
Business is the Ford of space manufacturing and Apple of technologies for space.

Well with five years out of that, what has been accomplished?
Build business(es) to subsidise income and build skills and knowledge for future ventures.
While the money side of this wasn’t the skills and knowledge certainly have, however in a state of always expanding this knowledge it can’t ever truly be complete
Build a reputation for consciousness and thought related to the universe and human exploration.
This from a philosophical standpoint I think I exist in, not sure what my reputation is, however I like to think I’ve come a long way in my understanding and philosophies, and my take on the universe and what it means to be a human.
Hone skills in business and project management, learn to communicate and build processes and automate systems.
Done, if I was to put an estimate to it, I’ve taken on at least 12 projects, and while many were not fully executed on, they could have been.
Project definition and outline
Done.
Hiring and filling roles
I think in total we’ve interviewed over 200 people in the past 4 years. Built an incredible onboarding process from scratch and just really nailed it in my opinion. Done.
Management of roles
Done.
Responsibility
Done.
Process development
Done.
Optimization
Done.
Automation
Done.
Repair credit
Done

There are other aspects I have been unable to pursue or haven’t completed which is through a lack of motivation or just missing the establishment of a rooted system. Those are things which I expect to work on and maybe adjust my goals or reassess my motivation for them in the first place. That being said of those which are reasonable and considered key aspects the completion rate is quite high for something which I set out to accomplish in 2016. Gives me some time to get the rest thought of and working on.

This leaves me in the next phase of my life, gives me time to reflect on my goals, where I want to take things.

From 2020 onwards some thoughts I have:

With immigration restrictions in the rest of the world and the focus on smart systems in China, I believe there is a huge shift in the intellectual capital towards Asia. It’s where the ML systems and truly innovative work in hardware is being done and if I was a betting man, I would say the innovation to come out of there in the next decade is going to be something to marvel at. 
I would say that space or commercial space is 10 years away from where I think my plans fit in with it. That being said by the time those 10 years come around, the expectation would be to be a player in the industry. Therefore there are many things to accomplish in the next 10 years. There are paths to get there and it is important to consider where those lead, for example the US is very protective of rocketry things and if you work for a company who does that, it might be hard to go other places after.
To play the game I want to play I need to amass capital. This could be through others, or through my own work, but it is part of the game, not the end game for me.

All of this requires further contemplation and will be a majority of my efforts over the next few months. I think though to bring it back into context, is this a ride you want to be on?
