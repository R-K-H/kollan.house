What is peace? And where can we find it?

Considering the extremes which come to mind, peace is absolutely a mindset which can be achieved at any point, more like achieving enlightenment, though. Probably something which not everyone will achieve.

But can we find peace in the moments we have together, the way we approach life, what we choose to do and not to do. Perhaps lifestyle and interactions have as much to do with having and holding peace as the mindset itself. However it would seem as if there is a balance, for even if we have nothing around us we could find a reason to not be at peace.

>“If you are depressed you are living in the past if you are anxious you are living in the future, if you are at peace, you are living in the present.” —Lao Tzu

A balance of how we live, how we choose to be, that is where we may discover peace, not that it just hits your blindside, it is a process.

Breathe, deep breath in, and out. You’re A O.K. today. Things have their places, people are satisfied, you are a blissful ball of happiness.

Remember to breathe today. Keep your thoughts light and heart on high.
