I'm sure yesterday was topsy turvy and a load of emotions for you. Here's a great quote from a great writer and human:

>“Give every day the chance to become the most beautiful day of your life.” - Mark Twain.

I certainly wish that for you. Even without me, (for who am I, in the grand scheme of things?) I hope you lay some foundation, that will never be rocked by silly people, with silly egos and silly ambitions, that you begin to climb, even faced with society (which is fucked in its own ways), to the heights I see you have in your sights. I'm not saying these things with an agenda, I'm saying because I look around and see it, clear as day (is day clear? well, whatever is clear...).

It's hard to see them ourselves sometimes, and we can lose ourselves. But at our core, we are there, we are us. Keep your mind, your focus, your approach, care, love, seek knowledge, demand more, expect less, live brazen, brush off that which matters least and appreciate the small things. It's easy to get caught up in this world, god knows I have, but you will never lose out by spending time on yourself, honoring yourself and respecting yourself, who you are (even if that changes and new discoveries expand you).
