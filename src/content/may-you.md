May you cast inspiration in the wake of your steps. 
May inspiration come easy, creativity flow and understanding be plentiful. 
May you find clarity where there was none. 
May you seek that which drives you forward.

In all that you do find joy and remember, weâ€™re on a floating rock traveling at 220 kilometers per second (and only in reference to our galaxy).
