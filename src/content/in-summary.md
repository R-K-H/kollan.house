As 2020 is fast coming to a close.

There’s been a lot going on, but I stand by the words produced herein. There is a certain beauty in a reflection of a year. Tears of joy, of sorrow, exacerbation of excited emotions, and the culmination of energy and efforts exerted into the final page of the chapter.

There is a cleanliness to finality. A composure in closure.

But if there is anything life has taught me, expect the unexpected and hold your tongue fast. Two things which are quite hard to do, by the simple nature of.

I’m pretty sure I didn’t handle this year well, and despite that accomplished magnitudes more than I ever dreamed. Even without much to show, the knowledge gained, the experience, is worth its weight in gold. In all that has unfolded, a certain gumption has been obtained and a reservation constructed to hold fast despite the affronts facing you.

I think 2020 has showcased the best and the worst of us. How we react under pressure, how we deal with a lack of control, what we chose to occupy our time with, what is important, and what is not. 

The one thing I keep coming back to is people. Surround yourself with those who challenge you to become a better version of yourself. Don’t put up with those who put you down, or keep you down. Think bigger, do more, and focus on building a toolset that is resilient and is always put to use. It’s easy to get caught up in where we are now, to not think of a future, however I’d suggest we consider the now, the present, as a focal point to direct the paths forward.

It hasn’t been easy, but nothing ever worth it is, and “anyone telling you otherwise is selling something.”
