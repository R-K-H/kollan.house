The questions we ask ourselves. Very unique, but not all in the sense of theme. I’d argue that we ask very similar questions of ourselves, to ourselves. I was reminded the other evening, “you are the only person who cannot see yourself, and you’re the only person that cares.” How is we we find ourselves in this circular reasoning, this faulty logic which has us chasing our tails over and over again?

I think it’s the nature of being, existence. In a sense, my case would be, we exist in the duality of everything and nothing. So therefore a circular pattern would be completely called for, expected.

So what does it mean? It means by default we push and pull, by the nature of things, it’s the distinct flow of the universe we occupy. That we can challenge it completely, but we must understand. It means we are, we breathe, our minds hold space in this world (which sometimes can be lost). It also means that maybe we do not need to ask the questions, or that we don’t need to experience the emotions, that we do, maybe that resistance is, what causes the conflict.

We face challenges, in all that we do, in our own ways. It’s all relative. And in that, I’d say, we have the full experience. Without, what is? Without darkness, what is light?

So how does this matter, why is this something worth reflection? I’m not sure, it’s late and I should finish this thought later.
