>“Don't be reckless with other people's hearts, don't put up with those who are reckless with yours.”

In all that we are, in all that we do, there are a few things which define us more. The adage: people won’t remember what you say, they will remember how you made them feel, is something I think we all should take into consideration. Although, it’s ironic that sometimes we want what we can’t have, or remember the good more than the bad, forgive and forget faster than we probably should (in certain cases).

I’m not saying forgiveness or keeping a positive mentality is bad. Not at all. Just that in reference to the beginning quote, it can cause us to neglect ourselves, our respect for ourselves.

We may put up with more than we should, our investments into relationship may show poor results, don’t let that sour our worldview, or our view of ourselves, reinforce negative self image. Do not let that define you.

It’s not always easy to find out who someone is, or how they will treat you, but in the time you do, remember, for in that you will know where to place your time, effort and energy.

Time is the one thing we can never get back (although people do try to buy it back) so be cognisant of what you spend it on, and who.

There is plenty of love out in the world, it starts with you, loving yourself, and it will come back in ways you could never imagine now.

Keep your head up, even in the hard times, it is not a reflection of you, but a reflection of where you’ve come from. It is not defining, it is a learning opportunity. It is not the world, it is a singular person.

It can be hard, it will be challenging, but through those moments we learn something about ourselves and during that discovery we grow. And in that growth some day you will be invested in something where all your needs met and never have to deal with anything like this ever again.
